## About the Book
"Modern Data Mining with Python" is a guidebook for responsibly implementing data mining techniques that involve collecting, storing, and analyzing large amounts of structured and unstructured data to extract useful insights and patterns.
 
Enter into the world of data mining and machine learning. Use insights from various data sources, from social media to credit card transactions. Master statistical tools, explore data trends, and patterns. Understand decision trees and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Manage high-dimensional data with dimensionality reduction. Explore binary classification with logistic regression. Spot concealed patterns with unsupervised learning. Analyze text with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and visuals with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Ensure model compliance with regulatory standards.
 
After reading this book, readers will be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to use Python for data mining and analysis in an industry set-up. They will be able to analyze and implement algorithms on large structured and unstructured datasets.
